# Leetcode problems 

## Description

Welcome to this repository containing my solutions to various LeetCode coding problems! This is a great resource for practicing your problem-solving skills, sharpening your understanding of algorithms and data structures, and preparing for technical interviews. In this repository I made three different folders for different problems. The problems which are labelled Easy in Leetcode is in the folder name "easy problems" , the problems labelled Medium in Leetcode is in the folder named as "medium problems" and the problems labelled as Hard in Leetcode are present in the folder named as "hard problems". The filename of each java file is according to the heading of the problems as per Leetcode.


## Getting Started

There are no specific dependencies required to run the code in this repository. However, having a Java development environment set up (JDK and IDE) is recommended.If you are using online compiler or the leetcode integrated editor then no JDK will be required. 

## Contributing
